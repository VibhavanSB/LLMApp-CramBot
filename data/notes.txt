Answer Key

1. Planetary differentiation is the process by which a planet's interior separates into layers of different densities. For differentiation to occur, the planet must be a mix of materials with different densities, and the material inside must be able to flow, which suggests it was once warm enough to be molten. Gravity then pulls the high-density material, like metals, to the center, while lower-density rocky material rises to the surface.
2. The three main layers are the core, mantle, and crust. The core is the highest density layer, composed of nickel and iron. The mantle has a moderate density (3.5-5 g/cm³) and is composed of silicon, oxygen, and other elements. The crust is the lowest density layer (about 3 g/cm³) and is composed of rock types like granite and basalt.
3. For a world to have a magnetic field, it must meet three requirements. First, it needs a molten, electrically conducting interior. Second, convection must be occurring within that molten layer. Third, the planet must have a moderately rapid rotation.
4. The primary function of Earth's magnetosphere is to protect the planet from charged particles streaming from the Sun, known as the solar wind. This zone of magnetic influence traps particles, and when these charged particles energize the upper atmosphere near the magnetic poles, they cause an aurora.
5. The four major geological processes are impact cratering, volcanism, tectonics, and erosion. Impact cratering is caused by collisions with asteroids or comets. Volcanism is the eruption of molten rock onto the surface. Tectonics is the disruption of a surface by internal stresses. Erosion involves surface changes made by wind, water, or ice.
6. Plate tectonics is the theory that explains how slow motions within the mantle move large segments of the Earth's crust, or lithosphere. The primary driving force is convection of the mantle, which creates stresses in the crust called tectonic forces, causing the plates to move apart, collide, or slide past one another.
7. The four primary types of rock are igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, and primitive rock. Igneous rock is the term for any rock that has cooled from a molten state. The two main types of igneous rock that form Earth's crust are oceanic basalt and continental granite.
8. The greenhouse effect warms a planet when its atmosphere allows visible light from the sun to pass through and warm the surface. The planet's surface then radiates this energy back as infrared light, which is absorbed and trapped by atmospheric gases. Without this effect, Earth's average temperature would be approximately 31°C colder.
9. The two lowest layers are the troposphere and the stratosphere. In the troposphere, the lowest layer, temperature drops with increasing altitude. In the stratosphere, which is above the troposphere, temperature rises with altitude in its lower part (due to ozone absorbing UV light) before dropping again in its upper part.
10. The sky appears blue because air molecules scatter blue light from the Sun more effectively than they scatter red light, making the blue light appear to come from all directions. Sunsets appear red because sunlight must pass through more atmosphere to reach an observer; most of the blue light is scattered away, leaving the less-scattered red light to dominate the view.

Essay Questions

Instructions: Formulate detailed, comprehensive answers to the following essay prompts, synthesizing information from across the source materials.

1. Discuss the process of planetary differentiation, including the necessary conditions for it to occur and how it resulted in Earth's layered internal structure (core, mantle, crust). Use specific details about composition, depth, and density for each layer as provided in the texts.
2. Explain the theory of plate tectonics as the primary driver of geological change on Earth. Describe the forces behind plate motion, the different types of interactions at plate boundaries (rift zones, subduction zones, faults), and provide at least three specific examples of geological features on Earth created by these processes.
3. Describe the three requirements for a planet to generate a magnetic field and explain the structure and function of Earth's magnetosphere. How does the magnetosphere interact with the solar wind, what are the Van Allen belts, and what visible phenomenon does this interaction create?
4. Detail the mechanism of the greenhouse effect on a planet like Earth. Explain how atmospheric gases interact with different wavelengths of light and what the consequences would be for Earth's average temperature if it had no atmosphere. Furthermore, discuss how a planet's albedo and distance from the Sun also influence its surface temperature.
5. Compare and contrast the four major geological processes that shape terrestrial surfaces: impact cratering, volcanism, tectonics, and erosion. Explain how the density of craters on a planetary surface can be used as a tool to infer its geological age and the level of its geological activity.

Glossary of Key Terms

Term	Definition
Accretion	The process of growth or increase, typically by the gradual accumulation of additional layers or matter, relevant to the formation of young planets.
Albedo	The fraction of incoming sunlight that a planet reflects. Planets with low albedo absorb more sunlight and have hotter temperatures.
Atmosphere	A layer of gas that surrounds a world. On Earth, it is about 10 kilometers thick and consists mostly of molecular nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂).
Aurora	A natural light display in the sky, caused when charged particles from the solar wind energize the upper atmosphere near a planet's magnetic poles.
Basalt	A type of volcanic (igneous) rock that makes up most of the oceanic crust. It is produced by the cooling of volcanic lava.
Climate	A term used to refer to the effects of the atmosphere that last through decades and centuries.
Conduction	The process by which heat is transferred from hot material to cool material through direct contact.
Continental Drift	The idea, inspired by the puzzle-like fit of continents, that continents have moved over Earth's surface. It is a component of plate tectonics.
Convection	The transport of heat as hot material rises and cool material falls. This process in the mantle drives plate tectonics.
Core	The central, highest-density region of a planet. Earth's core has a diameter of 7000 km and is composed primarily of nickel and iron.
Crust	The lowest-density outer layer of a planet. Earth's crust is 20-70 km thick for continental crust (granite) and about 6 km thick for oceanic crust (basalt).
Differentiation	The process by which gravity separates materials according to density, with high-density materials sinking to the center and low-density materials rising to the surface.
Erosion	Surface changes made by wind, water, or ice.
Exosphere	The highest layer of the atmosphere, where it gradually fades into space. It is warmed by X-rays and UV light, and atoms can escape into space.
Faults	Cracks in a planet's crust where plates slide parallel to each other. The San Andreas Fault is a major example.
Granite	A type of silicate (igneous) rock that predominantly makes up the continental crust.
Greenhouse Effect	The process by which atmospheric gases allow visible sunlight to warm a planet’s surface but absorb infrared photons radiated from the surface, trapping heat.
Igneous Rock	Rock that has cooled from a molten state. Examples include basalt and granite.
Impact Cratering	The geological process involving impacts by asteroids or comets on a planet's surface. Craters are typically 10 times wider than the object that created them.
Lava	Molten rock after it reaches the surface. The thickness of lava determines the type of volcano it forms (plains, shield, or stratovolcano).
Lithosphere	A planet’s outer layer of cool, rigid rock that "floats" on the warmer, softer rock beneath it.
Magma	Molten rock while it is still beneath the surface.
Magnetic Field	A field generated by the motion of charged particles. A planet's magnetic field is created by motions in its molten metallic core.
Magnetosphere	The zone of magnetic influence surrounding a planet, where the magnetic field dominates over the interplanetary magnetic field. It protects the planet from the solar wind.
Mantle	The layer of moderate-density rock surrounding a planet's core. Earth's mantle has a depth of 2900 km and is composed of silicon, oxygen, etc.
Metamorphic Rock	Rock that has been physically or chemically altered by high temperature or pressure without melting.
Ozone (O₃)	A molecule made of three oxygen atoms, found in the stratosphere. It is a good absorber of ultraviolet light, protecting the surface.
Plate Tectonics	The geological theory that explains the movement of Earth's lithospheric plates, driven by mantle convection, which shapes the planet's surface features.
Primitive Rock	The original rock from which the planetary system was made, such as that found in comets and asteroids. It has largely been chemically modified on Earth.
